Imagine you have been given a text with a series of links to places you need to go.

Perhaps you would normally copy and paste these links into your preferred browser and go.

With this page you can skip copy and pasting several links and just make whatever text that is a link into an actual clickable link

This may sound link something pretty mundane, but is actually something I needed for work, since sometimes I save reference url in text files and need to access those urls later... and I don't like copy pasting things around when a smarter solution is at hand :)
